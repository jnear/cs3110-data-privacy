# Installing Jupyter Notebook

## Step 1: Install Anaconda

First, install the Anaconda distribution of Python, which includes
Jupyter Notebook.

The Anaconda package includes Jupyter Notebook, or makes it easy to install.

## Step 2: Verify Anaconda

Check that you can run the `conda` command, to verify that Anaconda
was installed successfully.

- On Windows: Launch the "Anaconda Prompt" program from the start
  menu. Run the command `conda list`. The command should display a
  list of the installed packages.
  
- On MacOS: Launch a terminal. Run the command `conda list`. The
  command should display a list of the installed packages.

- On Linux: Launch a terminal. Run the command `conda list`. The
  command should display a list of the installed packages.

## Step 3: Start Jupyter Notebook

Run the Jupyter Notebook server to start using notebooks.

- On Windows: Launch the "Anaconda Prompt" program from the start
  menu and run the command `jupyter notebook`
  
- On MacOS: Launch a terminal and run the command `jupyter notebook`

- On Linux: Launch a terminal and run the command `jupyter notebook`

The notebook server should start, and the Jupyter Notebook file
browser should load in your web browser.

If you get a "command not found" error, run the command `pip install
jupyter` to install Jupyter Notebook, then try the above command
again.
